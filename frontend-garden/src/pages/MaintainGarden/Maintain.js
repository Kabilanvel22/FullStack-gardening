            <p className="maintain-para">Not all critters that you find in your garden are bad news. Insects such as Ladybugs, Bees, Praying Mantis, Hoverflies, Lacewings and Dragonflies play a crucial role in your edible garden and are vital to it's success. These insects help to pollinate your crops and control the spread of pests and diseases. Without beneficial insects, crop production would be minimal and pests would very quickly take over. For more on beneficial insects and how to attract them to your garden, be sure to read through the 'Beneficial Insects' guide.

            <p className="maintain-para">We are all aware of the importance of keeping a clean kitchen, but did you know that the same benefits apply to your garden? Keeping a clean garden is simple and doesn't require any special knowledge, skills or fancy cleaning products. What it does require is a little commitment and some elbow grease.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">It's important to clean your garden regularly by removing dead or diseased leaves off your plants, picking up fallen leaves and fallen fruit from in and around your garden beds and pulling up weeds as they appear. Weeds and decaying garden waste provide refuge for pests and can also harbor diseases that can affect your crops. It's amazing how many pest and disease issues can be avoided by having a tidy growing space
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">The reasons for keeping a kitchen hygienic are pretty self explanatory, and to a lesser extent the same reasons apply to your garden. It's wise not to add any diseased or insect infected matter to your compost pile, as they have the potential to re-emerge in your garden beds when the compost is added. Likewise, it's important not to compost any weeds that have gone to seed as they too may re-emerge.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">The same way that each member of your family receives a clean set of cutlery at meal time, it's essential that each one of your plants gets pruned with clean pruning equipment. Disinfecting your pruning tools between use on each plant will help eliminate the transfer of diseases from one plant to another.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Maintaining these simple practices in your garden will keep your plants healthy and growing well. Doing a little each week will help keep things in check and make your gardening experience more enjoyable.

            <p className="maintain-para">
              When watering your plants there are a few simple things to keep in mind. Since diseases require water for survival just as much as plants do, the way you water can make a big difference to your plants health.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">
              Watering at the base of the plant, rather than from above will allow the water to go straight to the root zone where it's needed, while limiting moisture on the plants foliage. Moisture sitting on foliage particularly overnight or in humid weather is the perfect breeding ground for diseases.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">
              If overhead watering is unavoidable, then it's best to water in the morning so that leaves have ample time to dry throughout the day. Watering in the morning also allows plants the time to absorb water without competing with evaporation from the midday sun.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">
              Be-careful not to over water your plants. The effects of over watering can look similar to those of under watered plants, so it's easy to misinterpret these signs. Unfortunately, a plant that has been over watered is a lot harder to save than a plant that has been under watered. Over watering causes plant roots to rot which essentially leads to suffocation and drowning. The base of the stem may become soft and mushy, plant leaves will begin to drop off and signs of fungal growth may appear on the soils surface.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">
              Daily watering is not required. Deep watering less often, is so much more beneficial to plants than quick, shallow watering done more often. Only water when required. Before watering, place your finger into the soil as far down as it can go and only water if the soil feels dry at a fingers depth. Don't water during or after periods of heavy rain, water less often in cooler seasons and water regularly in hot, dry conditions.
            </p>

            </span>
            <p className="maintain-para">In order to maintain a healthy and productive garden, it's vital to care for the health of your soil.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">It's essential that soil nutrients are continuously being replenished, particularly at the start of each growing season. Crops grown in depleted soils donâ€™t have enough minerals to produce the nutrient-rich food that our bodies require. Stressed, nutrient deficient plants are also the first to succumb to pest and disease attacks. Healthy plants are more resilient as they have a stronger immune system to fight against pest and disease damage and other environmental stressors.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">The good news is, replenishing your soil is easy. The following suggestions are effective ways of maintaining great soil.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Compost is essential for soil health. Simply adding a few inches of organic matter in the form of finished compost and/or well-rotted animal manure (cow, sheep, chicken, horse) before each growing season will do wonders for your soil. Compost enriches soil by improving its structure and increasing its water holding capacity. It improves drainage in clay soils and water retention in sandy soils. Compost provides a habitat for beneficial soil life, from beneficial bacteria to earthworms.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Earthworms break down organic matter, releasing essential nutrients and minerals into the soil which work as a natural fertiliser. Earthworms also help aerate the soil by building tunnels, creating loose and fluffy soil which is perfect for root development and increasing the plants ability to access water.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Seaweed is full of essential minerals that do great things for soil and plant health. Seaweed improves soil structure and increases it's moisture holding capacity. Seaweed also encourages the growth of beneficial microorganisms, who make nutrients available to your plants by converting them into forms that are easy to absorb.
            </p>

            </span>
            <p className="maintain-para">There is nothing more beneficial for your plants than homemade compost. The range of nutrients that compost provides is second to none. The great thing about compost is that it feeds the soil as well as the plants and releases nutrients slowly so that the plants can uptake them as required. Compost also improves soil structure, providing the ideal growing conditions for plants.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Fertilizers are another way of providing your plants with an additional boost of nutrients. Fertilizers are plant food, so its vital to ensure that they are well balanced. When and what you feed your plants, is very important to their overall health as well as the health of the soil. There are certain times throughout the season when plants really benefit from a good boost of energy, these include times of poor weather, pest attacks and during periods of flowering and fruiting. Regular feeding is vital for plants that are growing in containers as the nutrients in the soil are depleted at a much faster rate than in ground soil.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Plants require three main elements to maintain good health.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nitrogen (N) to produce leafy green growth</li>
              <li>Phosphorus (P) for a healthy root system as well as new growth</li>
              <li>Potassium (K) for flowering, fruiting and general hardiness </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="maintain-para">Commercial fertilizers, both organic and inorganic will provide a balance of all three of these elements. Fertilizers which are targeted to specific plants will have varying quantities of these elements to achieve certain outcomes.

            </span>
            <p className="maintain-para">Interplanting and dispersing crops around your garden makes them harder for pests to find. For example, planting Cabbage or Broccoli in a few different locations throughout your garden, rather than having a whole bed dedicated to them will make the crops harder for pests to discover. If one section gets discovered by pests, than the others will have more chance of staying safe as they are further away.
            </p>
            <p className="maintain-para">Interplanting herbs and flowers is another effective way to protect your garden from pests. Edible flowers such as Marigolds, Nasturtiums and Lavender help mask the scent of your prized edibles and seem to repel insect pests. Herbs such as Dill and Fennel, attract beneficial insects that prey on garden pests. Planting a range of crops as well as strong smelling herbs in and around your vegetable garden will create a diverse and healthy ecosystem that will help limit and control potential pest outbreaks.
